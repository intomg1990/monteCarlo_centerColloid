# Ewald Summation for Salt and Central Colloid

This is a program that shall be used as template to more complicated simulations, mainly simulations of charge regulation of colloidal particles.
We will have a simple colloidal particle at the center with dissolved salt and counterions in the simulation box. 
The simulation box is a cube and it is replicated by simple periodic boundary condition.
To calculate the total energy of the system, and then proceed with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, we will use Ewald Summations.
